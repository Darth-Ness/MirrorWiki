# MirrorWiki
MirrorWiki aims to be the simplest wiki ever. Thanks to @mrvautin for [downa](https://github.com/mrvautin/downa/)!

## Features
  * Extensible: Don't like something? The server is only a ten line NodeJS script. Just change it.
  * Supports Markdown and HTML out of the box (uses [downa](https://github.com/mrvautin/downa/) for converting Markdown into HTML)
  * Urls of the articles matches the layout of the filesystem
  * Zero configuration
